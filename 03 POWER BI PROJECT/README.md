## Happiness Project: A Data-Driven Analysis of Well-being
### Overview üìä
This project is a comprehensive data analysis on the key drivers of human happiness and well-being. Using a dataset of 50 individuals from various demographics and regions, the project explores the complex relationship between happiness and factors like social connection, lifestyle choices, and personal purpose. The final output is an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides actionable insights, moving beyond simple data to tell a compelling story.

### Project Goal üéØ
The primary objective of this project was to:

Identify and quantify the most significant predictors of happiness.

Determine how lifestyle choices (e.g., physical activity, vacations, social events) and personal factors (e.g., sense of purpose) influence overall well-being.

Demonstrate that happiness can be influenced by intentional behaviors, not just external circumstances.

Showcase data analysis and business intelligence skills by creating a professional, easy-to-understand dashboard.

### Data & Methodology üìà
The project dataset includes 50 rows of simulated data with 20+ columns. Each row represents an individual, with columns detailing their self-reported happiness score and various lifestyle, social, and health parameters.

### Key Data Columns:

Overall Happiness Score (1-10): The primary metric.

Social Connection Score: Quantifies the strength of social bonds.

Physical Activity (min/week): Measures physical exertion.

Sense of Purpose (1-10): A key psychological factor.

Vacation Frequency & Meetup/Event Attendance: Metrics for leisure and social life.

Income Level: A demographic control variable.

### Methodology:

Data Cleaning & Transformation: Utilized Power Query within Power BI to clean, structure, and prepare the raw data. This included handling missing values, changing data types, and creating new calculated columns (e.g., Happiness Category).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed initial analysis to identify trends and potential correlations.

Advanced Visualization: Created a range of visuals, including:

Clustered Column Charts to compare happiness across different demographics (age, gender, income).

Scatter Plots to reveal correlations between happiness and specific behaviors like physical activity and social attendance.

Donut & Funnel Charts to visualize the distribution of happiness categories among different groups.

Box and Whisker Plots to show the statistical spread and distribution of happiness scores for different groups.

### Key Insights ‚ú®
The analysis revealed several powerful insights:

Social Connection is a Primary Driver: The strongest and most reliable correlation was found between happiness and strong social bonds, often outweighing the impact of income.

Purpose over Materialism: Individuals with a high Sense of Purpose consistently reported higher happiness scores, regardless of their income level.

Actionable Behaviors Matter: Simple, repeatable actions like consistent physical activity and attending social meetups showed a clear, positive relationship with overall well-being.

The Power of Experience: The data suggests that engaging in leisure activities, like vacations and local exploration, has a strong positive effect on happiness.
